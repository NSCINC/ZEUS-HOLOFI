## ✨ Project Overview

**Zeus HoloFi** is a cutting-edge platform developed by HoloFi, focusing on artificial intelligence and decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging the latest technologies, Zeus aims to deliver secure, efficient, and intelligent solutions for managing digital assets and executing smart contracts. Our mission is to redefine how digital interactions occur, ensuring users benefit from advancements in AI and blockchain technology.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have compilers for C and Java installed on your system.
- Install Node.js and npm for managing dependencies and running backend services.
- Set up Rubyx and Lua for scripting and automation tasks.
- Configure a Shell environment for executing scripts.
- Install Go for service development.
- Basic understanding of C, Java, Node.js, Shell, Rubyx, Lua, Go, and ABC is required.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nscinc/zeus-holofi.git
```

### Install Dependencies:

```sh
cd zeus-holofi
npm install
```

### Configure the Zeus Network:

1. Ensure your Zeus client is running and synchronized.
2. Set environment variables in the `.env` file with details for your HoloFi network.

### Deploy Smart Contracts:
